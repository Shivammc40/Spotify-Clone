This project is a Spotify clone website that replicates some of the key features and functionalities of the popular music streaming platform, Spotify. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main focus of the project was to design and develop a responsive layout, implement styling using CSS, and incorporate interactive features using JavaScript.

Features
Layout Design: The project includes a well-structured layout that closely resembles the Spotify website. Headers, navigation menus, and various sections are organized using HTML to provide a seamless user experience.

Styling with CSS: CSS is utilized to style the project, manage colors, sizes of images, and create visually appealing components. The aim was to closely match the aesthetics of the original Spotify website.

JavaScript Functionality: JavaScript is used to implement the core functionality of the project. This includes features such as play/pause/seek functionality, track selection, and track changing. These interactive elements enhance the user experience and simulate a music streaming platform.

Funcionalities

Interact with the play/pause buttons, seek track progress, and select different tracks to experience the functionality. Note that this project does not include actual audio playback, but the interactive features are designed to simulate the behavior of a music streaming platform.
